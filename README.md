FSWP
===

FSWP is a delightful Windows Phone library.

The goal of this library is to provide a set of useful methods in order to make easier the implementation of some tasks and reduce the code needed.

The library contains different classes such as abstractions, managers or helpers divided in 4 namespaces:

* __Application__ - A set of classes to manage various elements of the application (culture, settings...)
* __Bindings__ - A set of classes and converters to make binding (especially for List in the current version)
* __Net__ - A set of classes to abstract network connections such as web requests or sockets
* __Utils__ - A set of independent classes that will help you for various tasks

> **Note:** FSWP library 0.2.2 is compatible with Windows Phone 7.1 and above.
> 
> It requires Microsoft Visual Studio or VS Express for WP.
